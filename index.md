I am a computer science researcher whose interests lie primarily in the Systems domain. I have been a part of projects in Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems and Computer Architecture. My current research is focused on using the P4 programming language to accelerate components in existing large scale systems. 

I am currently enrolled in the PhD program in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am a part of the Waterloo Advanced Systems Lab ([WASL](https://wasl.uwaterloo.ca/)) and my supervisor is [Dr. Samer Al-Kiswany](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alkiswan/index.html). Prior to this, I was enrolled in the master's program at Waterloo from 2019-2021 and I have been a Design Engineer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) from 2017-2019. 

I received my master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo in 2021, working under the supervision of  [Dr. Samer Al-Kiswany](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alkiswan/index.html). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from PES University in Bangalore, India and have been supervised by [Dr. K.V Subramaniam](https://faculty.pes.edu/p10213) and [Prof. Phalachandra](https://faculty.pes.edu/p10024). I was a research assistant at [CCBD](http://research.pes.edu/cloud-computing-big-data/) during my time there.

I have experience developing systems in numerous languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript and Python along with limited experience in Solidity.

## Side Projects

In my spare time, I like to develop applications using a variety of languages and tools to keep my skills sharp. Some of these projects and their source code are showcased in this section.

### MuZero on Super Mario Bros

This project attempts to evaluate MuZero, an algorithm for deep learning published by Google Deepmind in 2019, against Deep-Q-Networks with Double-Q-Learning, the state of the art model free algorithm using the game Super Mario Bros. Here are a few clips of a trained MuZero agent playing the game:

### The Crypto Lottery

This project consists of an Ethereum-based back end and a front end powered by React.js. The objective of this project was to build a lottery application where users register using Ether and stand a chance to win the Jackpot. 

The Jackpot is the prize pool consisting of contributions from all participants with the winner being chosen at regular time intervals. A participants chances also increase with the Ether they contribute up to a certain limit.

### Python Game Collection

I have developed a few games in Python 3.6 using the PyGame library. Some of them are showcased below.

#### Snake
This project is my implementation of the popular game Snake using Python 3.7 and PyGame.
