## Side Projects

In my spare time, I like to develop applications using a variety of lagnuages and tools to keep my skills sharp. Some of these projects and their source code are showcased below this section.

### The Crypto Lottery

This project consists of an Ethereum-based back end and a front end powered by React.js. The objective of this project was to build a lottery application where users register using ether and stand a chance to win the Jackpot. The Jackpot is the prize pool consisting of contributions from all participants with the winner being chosen at regular time instervals. A participants chances also increase with the ether he contributes up to a certain limit.
